You can use the [Shields.io](https://shields.io) service with the API endpoint generated by your repository's api directory. For example, the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upptime/upptime/master/api/google/uptime.json has the following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "label": "uptime",
  "message": "100%",
  "color": "brightgreen"
}
```

In the above URL, `google` is the name of your endpoint as defined in the `api` directory of your Upptime repository.

This translates to this badge: ![Uptime](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fupptime%2Fupptime%2Fmaster%2Fapi%2Fgoogle%2Fuptime.json)

```md
![Uptime](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fupptime%2Fupptime%2Fmaster%2Fapi%2Fgoogle%2Fuptime.json)
```

Similarly, response time badges are available: ![Uptime](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fupptime%2Fupptime%2Fmaster%2Fapi%2Fgoogle%2Fresponse-time.json)

```md
![Uptime](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fupptime%2Fupptime%2Fmaster%2Fapi%2Fgoogle%2Fresponse-time.json)
```
